I am a full-stack JavaScript developer and the Lead Developer at <a href="https://www.exclamationlabs.com" target="_blank">Exclamation Labs</a>. I am a strong advocate of open source development and enjoy mentoring young and aspiring developers. Though I primarily work with JavaScript, I enjoy hacking on various hardware projects.

Originally from Raleigh, NC I currently reside in Frostburg, MD with my wife and two wonderful kids.
